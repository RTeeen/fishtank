Some work students could do:
  * add methods
  * add classes
  * refactor methods to be better encapsulated
    * better use of properties and methods?
    * just smaller methods?
    * getters that do computation?
  * replace some if-else logic with subclassing?

I'm kinda not sure about the latter two ideas, but the problem with the first two, as noted by KV, is that it's too easy
to do by copy-pasting without understanding.  I agree that that concern is real.


Desired features:
  * Seeds should be able to go above the top of the tank without despawning, so they can fall back in
  * Fish should change direction to face correctly
  * Seeds should have a timer; if they're unhatched (and still alive) when the timer ends, they hatch naturally
