Some work students could do:
  * add methods
  * add classes
  * refactor methods to be better encapsulated
    * better use of properties and methods?
    * just smaller methods?
    * getters that do computation?
  * replace some if-else logic with subclassing?

I'm kinda not sure about the latter two ideas, but the problem with the first two, as noted by KV, is that it's too easy
to do by copy-pasting without understanding.  I agree that that concern is real.
